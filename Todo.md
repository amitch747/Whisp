# TODO
- ~~Setup Tor, seems easy~~
- ~~Simple client file, build with tor. Should be able to send the file to ANY computer, run it, and see the server response message~~
- ~~Session creation. User creates session, gets sessionid, shares it, chats with other user.~~


- I do not know when the hangup signal is called. When a socket is freed? Maybe. Need to look into.
- Its for when we close(sockfd) but im not really doing that atm. Will be used later
- Control flow rework
- Partial sends
- Serialization??? - Maybe no need to do anything special here, only sending text. Keep it simple.
- Encapsulation protocol - Keep it similar to beej's example
- Message encryption
- Simple ui. Keep messages on screen for few seconds, then blow away.

- Seems easy. Install tor, add a couple lines to the torrc file.
