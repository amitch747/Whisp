# TODO
- ~~Setup Tor, seems easy~~
- ~~Simple client file, build with tor. Should be able to send the file to ANY computer, run it, and see the server response message~~

- ~~Session management~~
- ~~Partial sends~~

- Mutex lock for each sesison
- Threadcleanup incase of failure during the chat loop
