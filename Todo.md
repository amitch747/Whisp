# TODO
- ~~Setup Tor, seems easy~~
- ~~Simple client file, build with tor. Should be able to send the file to ANY computer, run it, and see the server response message~~
- Session creation. User creates session, gets sessionid, shares it, chats with other user.


- Message encryption
- Simple ui. Keep messages on screen for few seconds, then blow away.




# Network
- Partial sends
- Serialization??? - Maybe no need to do anything special here, only sending text. Keep it simple.
- Encapsulation protocol - Keep it similar to beej's example



- https://community.torproject.org/onion-services/setup/
- Seems easy. Install tor, add a couple lines to the torrc file.


- I do not know when the hangup signal is called. When a socket is freed? Maybe. Need to look into.
